## Description
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

USER STORY:
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

Getting Started
This Challenge will combine many of the skills you’ve learned over the first ten weeks of this course. To help you get started, we’ve provided some guidelines in addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.

Your application should use Jest (Links to an external site.) for running the unit tests and Inquirer (Links to an external site.) for collecting input from the user. 


The application must have these classes: Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must all pass.


Grading Requirements

Deliverables: 15%
A sample HTML file generated using the application must be submitted.

Your GitHub repository containing your application code.

Walkthrough Video: 32%
A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the Team Profile Generator and passing tests must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.

The walkthrough video must show all four tests passing from the command line.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate a generated HTML file that matches the user input.

Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%
Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

Uses the Inquirer package (Links to an external site.).

Uses the Jest package (Links to an external site.) for a suite of unit tests.

The application must have these classes: Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern.

Repository Quality: 13%

Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

Repository contains a high-quality README with description and a link to a walkthrough video.

How to Submit the Challenge
You are required to submit the following for review:

A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application and passing tests.

    Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
